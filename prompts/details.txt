Details from Last CEOGPT Action: 
Sentiment Analysis is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to detect and label sentiments in a body of text or audio/video for textual classification and analysis. The goal of Sentiment Analysis models is to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral by outputting a number between -1 and 1. Current models use fine-tuned transformers and open source datasets from sources such as Amazon, IMDB, Yelp, and Twitter. There are many APIs available to perform Sentiment Analysis on pre-written texts or audio/video files, such as AssemblyAI's Sentiment Analysis API, Twinword's Sentiment Analysis API, IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API, Amazon Comprehend for AWS Transcribe, and Google Cloud Natural Language API for Google Speech-to-Text. The current limitations of Sentiment Analysis models are the inability to accurately ascribe more nuanced attributes than positive, negative, or neutral, and the lack of open source datasets for audio.
