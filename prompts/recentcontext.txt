History: We have identified AI tools that can be used for data analysis: Tableau, RapidMiner, KNIME, Orange, and Google Analytics. We have also identified AI tools that can be used for business automation: IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and Microsoft Power Automate. We have also identified AI tools that offer audio-driven speech synthesis: Google's Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson Text to Speech, Microsoft Azure Text to Speech, iSpeech, and Neural Text to Speech by OpenAI. We have created twelve note files 'AI_Tools_1', 'AI_Tools_2', 'AI_Tools_3', 'AI_Tools_4', 'AI_Tools_5', 'AI_Tools_6', 'AI_Tools_7', 'AI_Tools_8', 'AI_Tools_9', 'AI_Tools_10', 'AI_Tools_11', and 'AI_Tools_12' documenting the AI tools and services we have identified so far, including a list of AI image generators, information about natural language processing (NLP), AI tools for predictive analytics, AI tools for robotics, AI tools for machine learning, AI tools for computer vision, and AI tools for natural language understanding.
