Time: Today is June 7, 2023. The Time is 2:13 AM.
Large Goal: Research and create 50 note files about different easy-to-use AI tools and online AI services that can be used to put together amazing business ideas.
Company Status: We have researched and identified AI tools that can be used for data analysis, and created twelve note files documenting the AI tools and services we have identified so far, including a list of AI image generators, information about natural language processing (NLP), AI tools for predictive analytics, AI tools for robotics, AI tools for machine learning, AI tools for computer vision, and AI tools for natural language understanding.
History: We have identified AI tools that can be used for data analysis: Tableau, RapidMiner, KNIME, Orange, and Google Analytics. We have also identified AI tools that can be used for business automation: IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and Microsoft Power Automate. We have also identified AI tools that offer audio-driven speech synthesis: Google's Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson Text to Speech, Microsoft Azure Text to Speech, iSpeech, and Neural Text to Speech by OpenAI. We have created twelve note files 'AI_Tools_1', 'AI_Tools_2', 'AI_Tools_3', 'AI_Tools_4', 'AI_Tools_5', 'AI_Tools_6', 'AI_Tools_7', 'AI_Tools_8', 'AI_Tools_9', 'AI_Tools_10', 'AI_Tools_11', and 'AI_Tools_12' documenting the AI tools and services we have identified so far, including a list of AI image generators, information about natural language processing (NLP), AI tools for predictive analytics, AI tools for robotics, AI tools for machine learning, AI tools for computer vision, and AI tools for natural language understanding.
Details from Last CEOGPT Action: 
Sentiment Analysis is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to detect and label sentiments in a body of text or audio/video for textual classification and analysis. The goal of Sentiment Analysis models is to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral by outputting a number between -1 and 1. Current models use fine-tuned transformers and open source datasets from sources such as Amazon, IMDB, Yelp, and Twitter. There are many APIs available to perform Sentiment Analysis on pre-written texts or audio/video files, such as AssemblyAI's Sentiment Analysis API, Twinword's Sentiment Analysis API, IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API, Amazon Comprehend for AWS Transcribe, and Google Cloud Natural Language API for Google Speech-to-Text. The current limitations of Sentiment Analysis models are the inability to accurately ascribe more nuanced attributes than positive, negative, or neutral, and the lack of open source datasets for audio.

Available Actions List:
- Text a Message to CEO. This action will text a CEO who can build on your skillset and give you more actions. The argument for this action is a string that is the text that will be sent to the CEO. Only use this to send a message, do not expect a response or any advice.
- Research about a Topic. This action will research about any given topic and provide you with details about the summary of the research. This action will set the details information. The input for this action is the search term that will be used in a web query such as google. Use this to learn more about the current state of the world and other useful information.
- View Notes. This action will provide you with details regarding the note txt files you have. These are files that you have been recording notes to. If the action input is empty, the list of files you have will be given as details. If you provide an action input, the first word will be used to determine the file and the contents of that file will be provided as the details instead. Use this to read about notes you have taken. Try to keep these notes simple.
- Append or Create Note File. This action will allow you to append any input onto a note file, specified by the <filename> which will be the first word of the action input. Everything after the first word will be considered as the data that gets appended. If the first word of the action input is a filename that does not exist, a new one will be created with the rest of the action input as the data. Blank action input would result in an error.

Narrow Goal: Identify and take notes on AI tools that can be used for sentiment analysis.
CEO Comment: We've made good progress on documenting AI tools for various applications. Now, let's shift our focus to sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a technique used in natural language processing to identify and categorize opinions expressed in a piece of text. Identifying AI tools in this area will be beneficial for our large goal.
Question: What action will you take based on all of this information? You must choose only from the Available Actions List. If you don't see any options, please Text CEO to extend your functionality. Text CEO is only used for adding new available actions. You can ask for features at a high level, like do emails, make a dropshipping account for a website, etc. And you can ask for multiple. Use the CEOGPT Plugin once to update. Only use the plugin once, later we can call CEOGPT again, but for now only one call.
