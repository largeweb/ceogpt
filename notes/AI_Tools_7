Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of computer science and AI which enables computers to understand text and spoken words much like humans do. NLP combines computational linguistics, statistical models, machine learning, and deep learning to process text or voice data and understand its full meaning, intent, and sentiment. NLP can be found in consumer services such as GPS systems, digital assistants, and customer service chatbots. It is also used in enterprise solutions to streamline business operations and simplify mission-critical processes. NLP tasks are used to break down text and voice data to help computers understand them better. Python programs have libraries and resources to help build NLP programs. IBM has innovated in the AI space by pioneering NLP-driven tools and services. The 2020s will bring major advances in language-based AI tasks, like GPT-3, which can produce short stories, songs, press releases, technical manuals, text in the style of particular writers, and even computer code.
